/**
 * Removing secrets before anything reaches disk.
 *
 * Lives in `shared` because two things need it: the event log and the
 * diagnostics bundle. A secret scrubbed from one and left in the other is not
 * scrubbed.
 *
 * Plan §4.4 requires this and, until now, nothing did it. Agents read `.env`
 * files, print environment variables, and paste tokens into commands; every one
 * of those flows through `command.output` or `agent.message.delta` straight into
 * the log. A local-first app still writes a durable file that gets backed up,
 * synced, and attached to bug reports.
 *
 * Applied on **write**, not on read (§4.4). Redacting on read would leave the
 * secret in the file, which is the thing that matters.
 *
 * The bias is deliberate: patterns are anchored to shapes that are unambiguous
 * (a `sk-ant-` prefix, a PEM header), because a false positive silently destroys
 * content a user needed. Where a shape is ambiguous, the value is left alone.

/**
 * `AgentAdapter` over `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`.
 *
 * Two decisions from plan §2.5 and §2.6 are load-bearing here:
 *
 *  - `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` points at the user's installed `claude`, and
 *    the SDK's per-platform binary is excluded from the workspace. It unpacks to
 *    ~257 MB and we do not ship it.
 *  - `settingSources` is deliberately **omitted**, so agents inherit the user's
 *    full config and behave exactly as they do in a terminal. The cost is that
 *    inherited MCP servers can take outward-facing actions, which is why
 *    `mcpToolCall` is a first-class approval kind.
 */

/*
 * Three of these described the SDK's abilities rather than the adapter's, which
 * made them claims Chorus could not honour:
 *
 *  - `fork`: true since the phase that implemented `AgentAdapter.fork` — a real
 *    branch via `forkSession` + `persistSession: false`, verified against the
 *    running CLI to leave the original session's context and stored transcript
 *    untouched. It was false while `conversation:restart` was the closest thing
 *    Chorus had, and restarting makes a *new* conversation, which is not a fork.
 *  - `planStream`: `plan.updated` is emitted only by the Codex adapter. Nothing
 *    in this package produces one.
 *  - `modelSwitchMidSession`: false again, and this one has been both. It was
 *    true while a card carried a per-conversation picker; that picker is gone —
 *    the model is chosen once, in settings, and reaches a session as
 *    `SessionOpts.model` at construction. `setModel` is still implemented, so a
 *    future caller costs nothing, but the flag describes what Chorus does rather
 *    than what the adapter could.
 *
 * Each flips back to true in the phase that gives it an implementation, not
 * before. A capability is a promise to the orchestrator, not a wish.

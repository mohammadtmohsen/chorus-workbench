/**
 * One `turn.started` per turn, which Claude does not send and this adapter owes.
 *
 * Codex has `turn/started`. The SDK's nearest frame is `system/init`, which
 * describes the *session* — cwd, model, tools, MCP servers, the CLI version —
 * and this adapter holds one long-lived `query()` in streaming-input mode, so it
 * arrives once while `result` closes every turn. Reading it as a turn start
 * produced one start for a whole session's worth of completions, and every
 * consumer that folds the pair reported the agent idle from the second turn on:
 * no working line in the transcript, no Stop in the composer, no sidebar mark.
 *
 * These tests are about the *pairing*, which is what nothing asserted before.

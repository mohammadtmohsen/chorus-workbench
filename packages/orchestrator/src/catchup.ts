/**
 * Lets an agent read what it missed while somebody else was talking.
 *
 * Chorus routes each message to the agent it was addressed to, which keeps cost
 * and duplicate answers down — but on its own it produces a conversation that
 * only looks shared. Ask Codex about something Claude just said and it has never
 * seen it: observed live, Codex answered "what i asked claude" by grepping
 * `~/.claude` off disk, because the transcript on screen was not in its context.
 *
 * So before an agent is asked to answer, it is handed the part of the shared
 * thread it has not seen. Delivering the message is what starts a turn, so the
 * catch-up rides along with it: no extra turn, no extra cost when nothing was
 * missed, and no second agent woken up to listen.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing are replayed:
 *
 *  - **Speech** — user messages and other agents' completed replies.
 *  - **Activity** — what another agent actually did: commands it ran and how
 *    they exited, files it changed, errors it hit. Speech alone left this too
 *    thin: an agent's summary of a failing test run is not the failing test run,
 *    and "why did that fail" is exactly the question the other agent gets asked.
 *
 * Activity is one line each, never a replay of the other agent's whole session.
 * Reasoning stays out — it is the agent's private working, and it is enormous.
 * Command output appears only when the command failed, which is the only time
 * anyone asks about it.
 *
 * When the budget binds, activity is dropped before speech: losing "claude ran
 * the tests" costs less than losing what claude said about them.

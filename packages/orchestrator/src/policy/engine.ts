 *
 *   1. Kinds that may never be auto-decided — no profile and no grant can
 *      override them.
 *   2. Deny rules. A deny is absolute; nothing later can un-deny.
 *   3. Session grants the user made themselves.
 *   4. Explicit `ask` rules, which outrank a later allow.
 *   5. Allow rules from the profile.
 *   6. Otherwise ask.
 *
 * Denies are evaluated before grants on purpose: "allow for session" should
 * widen what the profile permits, never reach past what it forbids.
 *
 * Grants sit above `ask` rules rather than below them. A rule outranking an
 * allow is a profile qualifying its own permissiveness; a rule outranking a
 * *grant* is the app ignoring an answer the user already gave, which is what
 * made "allow always" mean "ask me every time".

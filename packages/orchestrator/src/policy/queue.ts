/**
 * Holds approvals that are waiting on a person, for as long as that takes.
 *
 * **Nothing expires here, and that is a decision rather than an omission.**
 *
 * Neither provider imposes a deadline — the Claude SDK's permission prompt
 * blocks indefinitely by design, and an unanswered Codex `requestApproval`
 * hangs the turn (plan §2.2). The five-minute window this used to enforce was
 * therefore Chorus's own invention, and it existed to stop a closed laptop
 * wedging a session.
 *
 * It bought that at a price nobody chose. An expiry always **denied**, and a
 * denial is a real answer: walking away for six minutes silently told the agent
 * no, and the turn carried on as though you had meant it. Asked for directly —
 * "no expiry at all, never count the time, wait until the user answers no
 * matter how long it takes."
 *
 * What replaces it is not nothing. `drain` still resolves everything
 * outstanding when a session ends or the app closes, so quitting stays clean;
 * and a turn you no longer want is ended by the interrupt control, which is a
 * person deciding rather than a clock deciding for them. The timer's real job —
 * never leave a session with no way out — was already done by a button.
 *
 * `expiresAt` is still carried on the request and still written to the log. It
 * records what the adapter proposed. Nothing reads it back.

/**
 * What a document *is*, when it is not simply a file on disk.
 *
 * The extension used to ask `uriScheme === 'file'` and refuse everything else,
 * which is why a merge request diff and the left pane of a git diff both
 * reported nothing. They are ordinary `TextEditor`s — `vscode.diff` opens two
 * of them — so the selection was always there to read. What was missing is a
 * way to say *which version of the file* the lines belong to.
 *
 * Pure, and free of any `vscode` import, so the parsing can be tested against
 * real captured URI strings rather than through a mock of the editor.
 *
 * **An allowlist of shapes we have actually read, deliberately not Claude
 * Code's blocklist.** Its extension accepts every scheme it has not explicitly
 * excluded and sends `uri.fsPath`, which for a `gl-review:` document is
 * `/src/app.ts` — repo-relative, pointing nowhere. That is invisible there
 * because nothing downstream checks it; here Electron main re-validates every
 * path, so a guessed shape becomes a silent `unmatched` two processes away.
 * A scheme we have not parsed yields nothing, which the pill can explain.

     * on the reasoning that `fsPath` on a URI with an authority yields a

     * the root's case and separators.

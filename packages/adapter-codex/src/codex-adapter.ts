   * `thread/fork` rather than `thread/resume`: resuming rejoins the same thread
   * and everything said goes into it, while forking returns a new thread whose
   * `forkedFromId` names the original and whose turns never reach it.
   *
   * `ephemeral: true` is what keeps a throwaway question from becoming a thread
   * the user finds later — the server never materialises it on disk.
   *
   * No `lastTurnId`: every fork is taken at the thread's head. Forking at an
   * older turn is possible in the protocol and deliberately unused, because
   * Chorus's own log does not record turn ids it could point at.
   *
   * **`inherits` is honoured only as `'config'`.** `ThreadForkParams` offers
   * `baseInstructions` and a `config` map, neither of which is an off switch for
   * the user's MCP servers and hooks, so `'nothing'` has nothing to map onto
   * here. Silently accepting it would make the port's most safety-relevant
   * option mean two different things per provider, which is worse than refusing.

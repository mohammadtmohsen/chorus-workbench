/**
 * node-pty's `spawn-helper` is published without its executable bit.
 *
 * It is mode 0644 in the npm tarball, nothing in node-pty's own install or
 * postinstall scripts repairs it, and electron-builder copies the mode through
 * verbatim. The helper is exec'd on every `pty.spawn`, so without this the
 * terminal fails with a bare `posix_spawnp failed.` — measured, not assumed.
 *
 * Projects that compile node-pty from source never see this: `lib/utils.js`
 * prefers `build/Release`, and the linker sets the bit there. We deliberately do
 * not compile (`npmRebuild: false`), so the prebuilt helper is what ships and
 * this is ours to fix.
 *
 * **Order matters.** This runs before `codesign`, because changing a file inside
 * a signed bundle invalidates the signature — which would turn a working build
 * into the "damaged" dialog this whole hook exists to avoid.

/**

 * Deep, so the framework and helpers are sealed too, and forced, because the

 * replaced rather than added to.
 *
 * Failing loudly is the point: a silently unsigned build looks fine here and
 * is unopenable on the machine it was sent to.
 *
 * **`CHORUS_SIGN_IDENTITY` is set by `package-local.mjs` and by nothing else.**
 * Ad-hoc stays the default, so the release pipeline and every gate are
 * unchanged and the notes they publish about being ad-hoc signed stay true.
 *
 * The reason a local install wants more than ad-hoc is the keychain rather than
 * Gatekeeper: `--sign -` produces no stable designated requirement, so the
 * access list `safeStorage` needs has nothing to bind to and "Always Allow"
 * silently records nothing. `local-identity.mjs` has the whole argument.

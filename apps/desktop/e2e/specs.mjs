   * the project at module scope, launches twice because a session keeps the cwd

   *
   * **A subprocess rather than an import**, because that file does its work at
   * module scope: importing it would run the fixture and both launches as a
   * side effect of loading the registry, before the runner had started.

   * Its own `ok`/`FAIL` lines are replayed through `assert` rather than
   * collapsed into one exit-code check, so a failure names the claim that broke
   * instead of saying the script exited 1. `assert` throws on the first
   * failure, which is the runner's own semantics — the ✓ lines before it still
   * print, so the output reads as far as the break.

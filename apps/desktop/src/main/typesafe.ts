/**
 * Whether the stored TypeSafe key works, answered by using it once.
 *
 * **There is nothing to connect to, so "connected" is not a state this can
 * report.** TypeSafe has no session and no handshake — the key is presented on
 * every request — so the only honest question is whether a call made with it
 * succeeds. `api.md` documents exactly one endpoint and no `GET /v1/models`, so
 * there is no free way to ask.
 *
 * **Which makes the check billed, and that decides when it may run.** The
 * response carries a `usage` object with input and output token counts, so a
 * check on launch, on opening the sheet, or on a timer would spend the user's
 * money to draw a tick. It runs when a button is pressed and at no other time.
 *
 * **Main-side, like every other use of this key.** The value never crosses to a
 * renderer; the renderer asks for a verdict and is told one.

 * guessed, because a shape invented here would fail in a way that looks like a

 * at the network. `api.md` documents 401, 422, 429 and 529, and folding the

 * relaxes it *as a block* to make the workbench work. Because the workbench lives

 * is a separate document under a separate policy that the shell never sees.
 *
 * The relocated risk is the opposite one, and it is quieter. A fresh partition
 * starts with **no** CSP and **no** permission handler at all, so every directive
 * below is here because it had to be installed deliberately rather than because
 * it was loosened. An absent control is not a relaxed control; it is a dead one.
 *
 * Each line names what needs it:
 *
 *  - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'` — VS Code compiles regexes and evaluates
 *    generated code in its own runtime, and its workers are built from the
 *    bundle. `'self'` is still the only *origin*; no remote script is admissible.
 *  - `worker-src`/`child-src` with `blob:` — the textmate, language-detection and
 *    editor workers are started from blob URLs by the bundler's worker plumbing.
 *  - `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` — VS Code writes theme colours into inline style
 *    attributes on nearly every element it draws. There is no version of the
 *    workbench that runs without this.
 *  - `connect-src 'self' data: blob:` plus **exactly** `ws://<authority>` and
 *    `http://<authority>` for the one remote extension host Chorus spawned, with
 *    the port substituted at spawn time. Never a `127.0.0.1:*` wildcard: the
 *    port is ephemeral, so a wildcard is the tempting shortcut, and it would let
 *    *any* local server be reached from a renderer that runs third-party
 *    extension code. The narrow form is possible only because main reads the port
 *    back out of the child it started, which is the same fact that makes
 *    "never attach to a port Chorus did not open" enforceable.
 *  - `img-src` and `font-src` with that same `http://<authority>`, because an
 *    installed *icon* theme's images are served by that host: a policy that lets
 *    the renderer `fetch()` the theme's JSON but not load the images it names
 *    applies the theme and paints nothing.
 *  - `frame-ancestors 'none'` — nothing frames the workbench either. A workbench
 *    document that permitted framing is one an extension webview could try to
 *    frame.

/**
 * Finding the user's CLIs — the right ones — when there is no shell to inherit.
 *
 * Three problems, discovered in that order.
 *
 * Chorus drives the installed `codex` and `claude` (plan §2.5) and used to spawn
 * them by name, which works only because `pnpm dev` runs in a terminal and
 * inherits its PATH. An app launched from Finder gets `/usr/bin:/bin:…` and
 * little else, so packaged, every session would have failed with "spawn codex
 * ENOENT" — which reads as "not installed" for something the user can run.
 *
 * Then: a machine can have several. This one had `codex` 0.42.0 from Homebrew
 * and 0.146.0 from npm, and the login shell resolved to the Homebrew one, which
 * is old enough that `app-server` will not start. Picking the first path that
 * exists picked the broken one.
 *
 * So every candidate is asked its version and the newest is used. It costs a few
 * `--version` calls once per run, and it is the only rule that survives a
 * machine with history on it.
 *
 * And then a third, which the first two hid: a path is not enough. The npm
 * `codex` is a `#!/usr/bin/env node` script, so running it needs `node` on PATH
 * — and under a Finder launch there is none. It failed its own `--version`,
 * dropped out of the running, and the old Homebrew binary won by default. So the
 * app adopts the shell's PATH before it looks for anything.
 *
 * ## And a fourth, which is Windows
 *
 * A path is not enough there either, for a different reason: npm installs these
 * as `.cmd` shims, and `spawn` will not run a `.cmd` without a shell. So this
 * module no longer answers with a path at all — it answers with a
 * `ResolvedCommand`, and `command.ts` holds the platform reasoning. The
 * selection rule above is unchanged, and the macOS path through here is the same
 * one it always was.
 */

/**
 * Give the process the PATH the user's terminal would have.
 *
 * Called once at startup, before anything is spawned. Everything downstream —
 * discovery here, and the agent processes themselves, which inherit this env —
 * then behaves the way it does in a terminal. Without it a resolved script still
 * cannot find its own interpreter.
 *
 * The existing PATH is kept on the end, so a machine whose shell says nothing
 * useful is no worse off than before.
 *
 * **A no-op on Windows.** There is no login shell to ask and no `-lic` to ask it
 * with; a Windows process already inherits the user's environment from Explorer,
 * which is the thing this function exists to recover on macOS. Running it anyway
 * would spawn `/bin/zsh`, fail, and be caught — harmless, but it would also read
 * as though Windows were covered.

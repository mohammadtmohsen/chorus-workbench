/**
 * What a fork is asked when someone has lost the thread.
 *
 * **Not `explainPrompt` for a whole conversation.** Explain answers _what does
 * this mean_ about a passage in front of you. A recap answers _where are we_, and
 * its subject is the thing the conversation has drifted away from — so the
 * passage that triggered it is the one input the prompt must not lean on.
 * Nothing is quoted from the reply here, and that absence is the feature.
 *
 * **Everything it knows comes from the log, and it is told so.** This began as a
 * fork of the agent that spoke, on the theory that its memory was the cheapest
 * source of `Done`. Two things killed that. The memory is the thing that
 * *drifted* — asking a drifted context to describe the drift is asking the
 * symptom to diagnose itself — and, measured in the running app, a fork is
 * simply unavailable at the moment a recap is most wanted: Claude's session ref
 * only exists once it has spoken in this process, so right after reopening the
 * app there is nothing to fork and the whole feature was dead.
 *
 * So the reader is a **fresh** agent with no history, and the prompt carries
 * everything: the user's own messages as the task, and `recapLedger`'s counted
 * facts as the evidence. That is the project's own first rule applied properly —
 * the event log is the source of truth — and it is why the prompt has to say
 * "you were not part of this". A model handed a transcript it is told is its own
 * writes `I did X`; handed one it is told it is reading, it writes what the log
 * shows. Claude Code's own compaction prompt keeps an "All user messages"
 * section for the same reason the anchor exists.
 *
 * **The ledger is fenced off from the judgement.** Facts go in under a heading
 * that says they are Chorus's, not the model's recollection, the same way
 * `catchup.ts` marks its block `[Chorus]` rather than splicing another agent's
 * words in silently. Without the label the two blur and the board starts
 * asserting things the log never said.
 *
 * **Two numbers, not an adjective.** `explainPrompt` records that "short" drifted
 * twice before a number fixed it. A cap on lines alone produces four very long
 * lines, so lines and words are both bounded.
 *
 * **`Parked` exists because the complaint was "useful but scattered".** The
 * off-task material is worth something. Given nowhere to go it leaks back into
 * `Done` and the board stops being a board; given a bounded home it is preserved
 * and quarantined at once.
 *
 * The do-not-work clause is the same one `asideQuestion`, `explainPrompt` and
 * `translatePrompt` carry, for the same measured reason: without it a session
 * treats the request as the next turn of the work and starts doing things, which
 * no permission rule catches because reading files is allowed. A request for a
 * status board looks more like a task than any of the other three, and a reader
 * with no history has nothing else to be doing.

   * cannot have started a conversation and the guard fired only for someone
   * removing a working project on purpose. Remove is now offered on any
   * project's card, where having rooms open is the normal case rather than the

   * the invariant the guard was protecting: nothing is still resolving a root
   * through a record that is about to stop existing.
   *

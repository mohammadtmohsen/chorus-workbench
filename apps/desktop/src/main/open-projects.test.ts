/*
 * Ported from `open-sessions.test.ts`, which went with the file it tested.
 *
 * Most of what is here was never about sessions. It is the guard on
 * `WorkspaceSnapshot` defaulting, and the failure it catches is silent and
 * total: make one field required and an envelope written before that field
 * existed stops parsing, so the whole list is dropped and every open
 * conversation is lost with no error anywhere. Only a fixture written before
 * the field catches it, so those fixtures are carried over exactly.
 *
 * One test did not survive, deliberately: the bare-array legacy shape. There is
 * no legacy reader — a v1 entry carries a `cwd` and no project id, and adopting
 * it would mean inventing a project per path at read time, which is the
 * migration Phase 2 decided not to build.

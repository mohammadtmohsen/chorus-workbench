/**
 * What it takes to launch one of the user's CLIs, on either platform.
 *
 * `which.ts` used to answer this with a single path, which is true on macOS and
 * not true on Windows. There, npm installs `codex` and `claude` as a `.cmd`
 * shim rather than an executable, and since the CVE-2024-27980 fix (Node
 * 18.20.2 / 20.12.2) `child_process.spawn` refuses to run a `.cmd` at all
 * unless `shell: true` — which is not an option here, because the arguments
 * being passed include user text and turning on a shell turns on its
 * metacharacters with it.
 *
 * So a resolved command is a file *plus* the arguments that make that file
 * runnable, and the kind that says why.
 *
 * ## The three kinds, and why the caller has to care
 *
 * - `native` — a real executable. `file` is it, `argsPrefix` is empty. Every
 *   macOS case and a Windows `.exe`.
 * - `cmd-shim` — a Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`. `file` is `cmd.exe` and `argsPrefix`
 *   carries `/d /s /c <shim>`, so the caller spawns cmd and cmd runs the shim.
 * - `node-script` — the JavaScript entry point the shim would have run, found
 *   by reading the shim. `file` is that `.js`.
 *
 * The last one exists for one consumer. The Claude adapter does not spawn
 * anything: it hands a path to the Agent SDK, whose
 * `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable?: string` (read out of `sdk.d.ts`, not inferred)
 * is a single string with no slot for an argument prefix. `executableArgs`
 * looks like the way out and is not — its own doc string says "additional
 * arguments to pass to the JavaScript **runtime** executable", i.e. flags for
 * node, not a command prefix. So there is nowhere to put `cmd.exe /d /s /c`,
 * and the only shape the SDK can accept on Windows is the script itself, which
 * it will run under node.
 */

   * executable on Windows, so a probe that spawned it would fail where the same
   * command through `cmd.exe` succeeds. The script travels in `scriptPath`

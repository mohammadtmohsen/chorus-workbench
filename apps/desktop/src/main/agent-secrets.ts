/**
 * A credential an agent needs, encrypted, and reachable only from main.
 *
 * **Deliberately not `workbench-secrets.ts`, and the separation is the whole
 * point of this file.** That store is correct for what it holds and is wired to
 * a generic channel: `readSecret(key: string)` in the preload reaches a handler
 * that returns whatever key it is asked for, to any workbench surface, with no
 * allowlist. An installed extension asking for an agent's key by name would be
 * handed it in plaintext. So this keeps the same mechanism and none of the
 * reach — a different file, and no channel anywhere names it.
 *
 * **The key is a `SecretId`, not a string.** The workbench store takes a string
 * because a `secretStorageProvider` must; nothing here does, and a closed set
 * means there is no such thing as asking for a key this module did not intend
 * to hold.
 *
 * **`SecretId` is deliberately wider than `AgentId`, and deliberately not
 * `AgentId` itself.** A service an agent calls needs a credential without being
 * a voice in the cast: `ACTORS` in `@chorus/shared` spreads `AGENT_IDS`, and both
 * `AgentIdSchema` and `ActorSchema` are `z.enum` over those tuples — so a member
 * added there becomes a speaker the event log accepts, owing a colour, a label
 * and a row. The union keeps the closed set this file depends on without paying
 * for any of that.
 *
 * What a caller may learn from the renderer side is whether a key is *set* —
 * never the value. A renderer that can read it is a renderer that can leak it
 * into a transcript.

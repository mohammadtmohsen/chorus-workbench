/**
 * An agent's provider credential, encrypted, and reachable only from main.
 *
 * **Deliberately not `workbench-secrets.ts`, and the separation is the whole
 * point of this file.** That store is correct for what it holds and is wired to
 * a generic channel: `readSecret(key: string)` in the preload reaches a handler
 * that returns whatever key it is asked for, to any workbench surface, with no
 * allowlist. An installed extension asking for an agent's key by name would be
 * handed it in plaintext. So this keeps the same mechanism and none of the
 * reach — a different file, and no channel anywhere names it.
 *
 * **The key is an `AgentId`, not a string.** The workbench store takes a string
 * because a `secretStorageProvider` must; nothing here does, and a closed set
 * means there is no such thing as asking for a key this module did not intend
 * to hold.
 *
 * What a caller may learn from the renderer side is whether a key is *set* —
 * never the value. A renderer that can read it is a renderer that can leak it
 * into a transcript.

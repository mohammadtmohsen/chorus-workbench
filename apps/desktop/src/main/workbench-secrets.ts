/**
 * Where an extension's credentials live between launches.
 *
 * **Separate from `workbench-storage.ts`, and the separation is the point.**
 * They are written by the same kind of caller through the same kind of channel,
 * and folding them together would be one small refactor away from a GitLab
 * token sitting in the file people open to see why an extension keeps greeting
 * them. What is in here is different in kind: a `api`-scoped personal access
 * token is a live credential, and the file is treated accordingly.
 *
 * **Why anything is stored at all.** `BrowserSecretStorageService` is
 * constructed `super(true, …)` — `_useInMemoryStorage` hardcoded — so
 * `BaseSecretStorageService` always takes the `new InMemoryStorageService()`
 * branch and secrets never reach `IStorageService`. Nothing about the durable
 * storage added alongside this could have helped: a token was gone on every
 * quit, and signing in to GitLab was a thing you did once per launch. The
 * supported way out is `options.secretStorageProvider`, which the same
 * constructor checks for and which `get`/`set`/`delete` prefer when present.

/**
 * Encrypted with the OS keychain, never written as text.

 * VS Code desktop keeps secrets in the platform credential store, and the reason
 * to match that is not symmetry: the alternative is a readable `api`-scoped
 * token in a predictable path, which is worth strictly more to anything that can
 * read a file than everything else in this profile combined. `safeStorage` binds
 * the ciphertext to the macOS login keychain, so a copied file is inert on
 * another machine and on another account.
 *
 * **A profile whose keychain is unavailable stores nothing rather than storing
 * plaintext.** `isEncryptionAvailable` is false on a Linux box with no
 * keyring and during early startup before the app is ready; degrading to a
 * readable token is exactly the trade this file exists to refuse. The cost of
 * refusing is that an extension asks to sign in again, which is the behaviour
 * everybody already had.

/**
 * The flag that lets the transcript be measured without launching anything.
 *
 * **Tested through the runtime, not through the switch.** An earlier version of
 * this file asserted on the two command *resolvers* and passed while the mode
 * was wide open — because `startParticipant` calls `adapter.health()` before any
 * resolver is consulted, and both real adapters answer that by running
 * `claude --version` / `codex --version`. A review found it. The doors that
 * matter are the ones every agent path goes through, so those are what these
 * drive: `startConversation`, `addParticipant`, and restore.
 *
 * `health()` is counted rather than mocked away. If the guard is ever moved back
 * below it, these fail — which is the whole point, since in production that call
 * is a child process.

/**
 * The workbench IPC surface — two audiences, deliberately separated.
 *
 * Preflight §4.1a settled that the shell must never hold the workbench's
 * connection secret, and §4.1b settled that the workbench must never hold the
 * shell's `ChorusApi`. Those are the same rule read from both ends, and the only
 * way to keep both true is for the two sides to be handed different things by
 * different preloads. The schemas are shared; the exposure is not.
 *
 * So this file is one module with two halves that never mix:
 *
 *  - `WORKBENCH_SHELL_CONTRACT` — what the shell may say. It names surfaces by
 *    an opaque view id and carries no secret on any channel, which is what makes
 *    a leaked id useless: every operation it names is mediated by main and
 *    validated against the project main opened it for. The grant it redeems on
 *    `workbench:open` is not a secret either in the sense §4.1a means — it is an
 *    *authorisation*, and leaking one buys nothing, because main refuses it in
 *    any window but the one it was minted for.
 *  - `WORKBENCH_CONNECTION_CHANNEL` — what main tells one surface about itself.
 *    Generated into the workbench preload only.
 *
 * These channels are deliberately *not* in `IPC_CONTRACT`. That map's registrar
 * discards `event` by design, and preflight §4.1b rule 4 requires every workbench
 * request to be resolved from `event.sender` rather than from anything the sender
 * says about itself. Sharing the registrar would have meant weakening it.

 * What a surface is told about itself, and the whole of it.

 * the delivery mechanism was built the way it was rather than retrofitted around
 * a secret. Preflight §5.3: compromise of the connection token is compromise of
 * the machine — with it a caller can read and write any file the user can, spawn
 * processes, and install and activate an arbitrary extension. So the token
 * travels main → *this one surface* and nowhere else. It is never on a query
 * string, never in the shell's React state, and never in the event log, which is
 * `CLAUDE.md`'s "state is not history" applied exactly: a token read back a week
 * later is worse than having none.
 *
 * `commit` and `quality` are here because both must match the server and they
 * fail in two different ways. A `commit` mismatch is refused loudly in the
 * WebSocket handshake — `Client refused: version mismatch`. A `quality` mismatch
 * is never compared at all; it silently changes the `<quality>-<commit>` prefix
 * every resource URL is fetched under, so the socket opens and the workbench
 * 404-storms with nothing naming the cause.

/**
 * Which stored events the transcript actually draws.
 *
 * **Measured, not guessed.** On the author's database, the types marked
 * `ignore` below were **51,801 events and 51,949,730 bytes — 30.6% of all
 * stored payload**. Every one of them was read from SQLite, `JSON.parse`d,
 * validated against `ChorusEventPayload`, validated *again* crossing the IPC
 * boundary, structured-cloned into the renderer, and then dropped on the floor
 * by a reducer with no case for it. `command.output` alone was 34 MB.
 *
 * **This is a read filter, not a change to the log.** Every event is still
 * appended and still stored; the log remains the source of truth. What narrows
 * is one query, for one consumer — see `conversation:transcript`. Raw
 * `conversation:history` is untouched, because `SummaryPanel` counts failures
 * from `command.completed` and the e2e specs assert on `repo.changed.byUser`,
 * and both would break silently if this filtered the shared channel.
 *
 * **`Record<ChorusEventType, …>` is the whole design.** A plain array of type
 * names would be a second list to keep in step with the reducer, wrong the
 * first time somebody forgot it, and the symptom would be an entry that
 * silently stops appearing. Written as a total map over the union, a new event
 * type fails to compile until it is *classified* — which is the same discipline
 * the five downstream switches already enforce, for the same reason.
 *
 * An earlier draft of the plan said this list could be "derived from the
 * reducer's switch". It cannot: `TranscriptEvent.type` is `z.string()` and
 * `reduceEvents` ends in a `default:` arm, so there is nothing exhaustive to
 * derive from. The map is where exhaustiveness has to live instead.

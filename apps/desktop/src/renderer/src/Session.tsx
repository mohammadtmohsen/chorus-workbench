 * Things a click must not be taken away from.

 * Anything focusable does its own job with the caret, and the two blocking
 * cards are the sharp case: they focus a control so Enter can answer them, and
 * a click landing anywhere inside one would hand the caret straight back to the
 * composer and undo that.
 *
 * `.terminal-panel` is here for a reason the tag list cannot cover: xterm types
 * into a hidden `<textarea>` that is a *sibling* of the rendered rows rather
 * than an ancestor, so a click on the terminal's own output matched none of the
 * tags above and the composer took the caret. Typing into the shell then went
 * into the message box — observed, with the characters landing under the
 * transcript.
 *
 * **`.monaco-editor` is the same shape and was missed.** Monaco renders text as
 * `div.view-line`s and keeps its own hidden `textarea.inputarea` elsewhere in
 * the tree, so a click on a line of code matched nothing here either and the
 * caret went to the composer — which made a file impossible to edit. That the
 * xterm sentence above did not already cover it is the point worth keeping:
 * this list is about *where the click landed*, and any component that renders
 * its text separately from its input needs naming, not inferring.

                  — the drag was only how it got there, and it was also what made
                  the feature fail: `openAside` re-checks the text against the log,
                  and every piece of chrome inside `.entry` that the projection

                  genuinely is its subject. You translate a sentence, not an answer.

                  someone's own language, and an action that cannot say which one it
                  would produce is worse than an absent one.

                  rather than a decision — while an unlabelled icon is the least
                  legible thing on a bar people meet rarely. Icons for all of them is
                  defensible and is a different change; mixing is the only option

          Granted for the session, not remembered past it — and the default.

          The same ask arriving four times in a row is the commonest way an
          approval queue becomes something you stop reading, which is the
          failure mode the whole card exists to avoid. Answering it once per
          session is the answer most people mean, and making them reach past
          the armed key to say so produced the queue it was meant to prevent.

          It used to cost a deliberate press, on the argument that the wider
          grant should. What that argument missed is *how much* wider: a
          session grant ends with the window, so the blast radius of a mistaken
          Enter is this sitting, and the same mistake on Allow once costs a
          command you had not read either. The narrower button is not the safer
          one by enough to be worth the friction.

          Scoped to the session because a permission that outlived the window
          would be a policy change, and those are made in Settings where they
          can be seen — which is exactly why `mcpToolCall`, where this button
          means `always`, keeps Allow once as its default instead.

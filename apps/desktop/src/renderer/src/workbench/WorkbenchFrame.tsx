 * The shell's handle on one surface — and it contains nothing.
 *
 * The workbench is composited by the window, not by this subtree: the element
 * below is a placeholder whose only job is to have a rectangle, which main mirrors
 * onto a `WebContentsView` sitting over it. That is the cost preflight §4.1a
 * accepted when it chose the view over a frame, and it is why every layout bug
 * here is a two-process bug.
 *
 * This file must never pull a `@codingame/*` module into the outer bundle —
 * R1's 0.5 MB threshold is a leak detector for exactly that, not a budget. An
 * `import type` is erased before the bundler sees it, so it costs nothing and is
 * not the thing that rule guards; `workspace/overlay.ts` is forty lines of
 * React and imports nothing itself, which is the bar any future import here has
 * to clear. It used to say "nothing but React and a type", which read as a
 * stronger rule than the one that matters.
 *
 * It never sees a descriptor. It holds an opaque view id, which is useless if it
 * leaks because every operation it names is mediated by main and validated
 * against the project main opened it for.
 *
 * What it opens with is **never a path** — it is one of `WorkbenchTarget`'s two
 * arms, and both are things main can refuse. A **grant** is minted from the
 * native chooser and bound to this window, which is what a folder being adopted
 * for the first time produces. A **project id** names something already in the
 * registry, and `ProjectService.resolveRoot` refuses one nobody adopted; that arm
 * is what a project pane uses, because requiring a grant there would mean
 * re-choosing every project on every launch.
 *
 * `projectRoot` is here to be *displayed*, and nothing else reads it.

     * What stood here was a `ResizeObserver` on this element plus a `resize`
     * listener on the window — two subscriptions that between them cover *size*
     * and nothing else. An element moves without changing size constantly: a
     * sibling pane closing, a rail or a panel opening, an ancestor scrolling, a
     * tab strip reflowing, an animated layout settling. None of those is a resize
     * of anything either observer watched, so the view went on painting at its
     * old x/y over new content until something happened to resize it — not a
     * frame of lag, a permanently misplaced overlay.
     *
     * The answer is deliberately **not a third subscription**. Enumerating the
     * causes of movement fails silently by construction: the one case nobody
     * thought of produces no event, and a missing event looks exactly like a
     * stationary element. Measuring cannot miss a cause, because it never asks
     * what moved the element. The `IntersectionObserver` inset trick would be
     * cheaper at idle and buys the same silence at a higher price — its root
     * margins are subtle enough that arithmetic which is slightly wrong yields an
     * observer that quietly never fires.
     *
     * The cost is one `getBoundingClientRect` per frame per mounted surface, read
     * inside `requestAnimationFrame` — before style and layout, so it forces the
     * layout that frame was going to perform anyway, and nothing is written back,
     * which is what would make it thrash. The expensive part is the IPC, and that
     * is sent **only when the rectangle differs from the one last sent**, so an
     * idle workbench sends nothing at all after its opening report.
     *
     * Bounds are read in CSS pixels and sent as device-independent pixels, which
     * are the same number only while the zoom factor is 1. Chorus has a zoom
     * (⌘+ / ⌘−) and this still does not compensate for it, so a zoomed shell will
     * mispose the view. That half is untouched here on purpose: it is a unit
     * conversion, not a tracking failure, and it is recorded as such.

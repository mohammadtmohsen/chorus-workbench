 * `monaco-editor@^0.56.0` for the accepted-and-measured `MonacoDiff` Editor view,

 * naive alias would swap the Monaco under the existing diff editor for
 * CodinGame's fork, in the same build, with no error.
 *
 * Read out of the installed package rather than out of the documentation, and
 * **re-read at `33.0.9` rather than carried over from `36.1.1`** — a downgrade of
 * three minor releases is exactly the change that could have reintroduced it.
 * Across every installed `@codingame/*` package there is not one bare
 * `monaco-editor` or bare `vscode` import, in a runtime `.js` file **or in a
 * `.d.ts`**. So there is no alias here and no `paths` entry either: the question
 * does not arise at build time or at typecheck time, and the shell's real
 * `monaco-editor` under `MonacoDiff` is untouched by construction rather than by
 * scoping. The demo needs the alias because it declares `"monaco-editor":
 * "file:../dist/packages/monaco-vscode-editor-api"` in its own dependencies and

       *    silently changes every other one — including projects that are open,

       *  - **It defeats pinning.** Slice 5f pins the built-in language, Git and
       *    debug extensions to the server's own version; an auto-update walks
       *    one of them past the REH and produces exactly the client/server drift
       *    the pin exists to prevent.
       *  - **It invalidates the ledger.** `extension-ledger.md` records a result
       *    against a version — `bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss` at 0.16.0. An
       *    overnight update makes every proved row a statement about something
       *    that is no longer installed, with nothing to say it happened.
       *
       * Slice 5g wants updates to be **atomic** — client packages, REH,
       * built-ins and compatibility metadata moving together or not at all — and
       * per-extension background updates are the opposite of that.
       *
       * A default, not a forced value: `Extensions: Enable Auto Update` is still
       * there for anyone who wants it, and `Check for Extension Updates` still
       * works on demand.

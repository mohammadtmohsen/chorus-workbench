 * trusted built-in extension", and §5.2 schedules the external `.vsix` to be
 * reworked into a built-in one. That framing is inherited from the world where
 * Chorus had no code inside the editor and could only reach it through the
 * extension API. It has code inside the editor now: this module runs in the
 * surface's own document, calls the same services an extension would be a proxy
 * for, and already holds the preload that reaches main.
 *
 * An extension would be **weaker**, not stronger. It would run in the extension
 * host beside third-party code, it cannot reach `window.chorusWorkbench`, and it
 * would need a transport of its own — a socket main serves, with a token
 * delivered somehow — which is a new authenticated surface added to a boundary
 * Phase 1 spent review rounds narrowing. This needs none of that.
 *
 * **State, not history.** `CLAUDE.md`'s test: reading a cursor position back a
 * week later is worse than having none, so this travels on a push channel, is
 * held in memory by main, and has no `ChorusEventPayload`. Nothing here may ever

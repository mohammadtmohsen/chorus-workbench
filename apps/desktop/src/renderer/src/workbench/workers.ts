/**
 * The workbench's web workers — `BOARD.md` C-061.
 *
 * Nothing registered these, so every service that asked for a worker threw
 * `You must define a function MonacoEnvironment.getWorkerUrl or
 * MonacoEnvironment.getWorker for the worker label: …`. What a person noticed
 * was that Output-panel links were dead, which is trivial; the gap was global,
 * because **any** worker-backed service met the same wall — diff computation,
 * word-based suggestions, background tokenization and file search among them.
 *
 * **Read out of the installed packages, not out of documentation.** Each
 * override that needs a worker ships its own `./worker` entry, and the labels
 * below are the string literals those packages construct their descriptors with.
 * Guessing either half is the "inferred payload" failure `CLAUDE.md` records
 * against the adapters, one layer out.
 */

/**
 * `getWorker` rather than `getWorkerUrl`, and the choice is Vite's.
 *
 * `StandaloneWebWorkerService._createWorker` tries `getWorker` first and only
 * falls back to a URL. `?worker` hands back a constructor with the bundling
 * already arranged, whereas a URL would mean resolving a bare package specifier
 * at runtime — which `new URL(…, import.meta.url)` cannot do.

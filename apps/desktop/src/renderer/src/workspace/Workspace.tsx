/**
 * The shell: a rail of sessions on the left, panes filling the rest.
 *
 * **Reconstructed on 2026-08-14, and the reason belongs here.** A `git checkout`
 * of this file — run against a working tree where the rail work had never been
 * committed — reverted it to a version predating all of it. What follows was
 * rebuilt from the last production bundle, which is unminified and keeps its
 * region markers, so the *code* came back exactly. The comments did not: a build
 * strips them. Everything explanatory in this file was therefore written fresh,
 * and where a decision is not evident from the code it is now unrecorded rather
 * than wrong.
 *
 * The drawer went in the same pass, deliberately: `SessionList`, its resize
 * handle, the sidebar width, search, history and Arrange mode. Sessions are the
 * rail's tiles; what a session can do lives in its composer, in the card that
 * opens on hover, and — for the cast, the folder and permissions — in the menu
 * the composer's settings control opens.

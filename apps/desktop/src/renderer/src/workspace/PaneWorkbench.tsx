/**
 * One project's workbench, mounted for **every** tab in the pane rather than
 * only the active one.
 *
 * **This is the terminal rule, one level further out.** `WorkbenchFrame` already
 * documents that unmounting it closes the surface — a whole `WebContents`
 * destroyed, every open file lost, a reload on the way back — and that is why
 * the Editor switch passes `hidden` instead of not rendering it. Switching
 * project *tabs* had no such protection: the frame was rendered once for
 * `pane.activeTabId` and keyed on it, so changing tabs changed the key and React
 * tore the surface down and built a new one. Every switch paid a full workbench
 * boot, which on a cold cache is a download, a 257 MB extraction and a server
 * spawn. Reported as "the editor behaves like unmount and remount", which is
 * exactly what it was.
 *
 * So the frames are keyed by project and all of them stay mounted; only the
 * active one is visible, and switching is a compositing change. **The cost is
 * real and is accepted rather than unnoticed**: one live `WebContentsView` per
 * open project, on a memory ceiling the plan still owes as a number (R7/R11).
 * Chosen for two or three open projects; if that grows into eight, this is the
 * decision to revisit, and a bounded cache is the shape it would take.
 *
 * It is a component rather than a loop body because of the two hooks: the Editor
 * switch is stored per project, and the failure message belongs to the project
 * that failed. Holding the error here rather than in the pane also fixes a
 * mislabelling the pane's own comment warned about — a background surface that
 * refused used to write its message into whatever project happened to be on
 * screen.

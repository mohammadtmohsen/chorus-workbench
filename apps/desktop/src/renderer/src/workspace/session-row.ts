 * as a session at rest.
 *
 * `waiting` used to be one state covering both requests, and the pulse has
 * always carried them apart — `approvalIds` and `questionIds` were summed in
 * `hooks.ts` and the difference thrown away one line later. They are not the
 * same interruption: an approval is an agent **blocked** mid-turn holding a tool
 * it cannot run, and answering it is unblocking. A question is an agent that has
 * finished thinking and wants a person's input. One is stalled work, the other
 * is a conversation, and telling them apart at a glance is the whole reason a

/**
 * What is left of each account, as four readings rather than one.
 *
 * Both providers meter in rolling windows and simply stop answering when one
 * fills. That used to be reported as a single worst-case figure, which answers
 * "am I about to be cut off" and nothing else — not which account, not which
 * window, not whether the wait is an hour or a week. The rail has room for the
 * four separate readings, so it shows them: Codex 5-hour, Codex weekly, Claude
 * 5-hour, Claude weekly, in that order, every time.
 *
 * **The four slots exist whether or not anything has been pushed into them**,
 * and that is the whole point of this file. Deriving the list from the pushes
 * that have arrived produced a rail that showed two readings at startup, three
 * a second later, and four eventually — with Claude above Codex, because the
 * agent ids were sorted alphabetically. A monitoring column whose rows move is
 * one you have to read rather than glance at, and the figure in the top slot
 * meant a different thing from one look to the next.
 *
 * An unreported window reads as unavailable and never as `0%`. Zero is a claim:
 * it says the account is empty, which is the opposite of "nothing has said yet".
 *
 * Moved out of `ActivityBar` when the quick rail replaced it. It is state about
 * an account rather than conversation history, so it lives in a hook and never
 * reaches the event log — see the "State is not history" rule.

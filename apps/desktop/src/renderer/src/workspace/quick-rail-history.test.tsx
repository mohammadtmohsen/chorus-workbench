/**
 * The rail has a door to the history sheet.
 *
 * **This is the guard for a feature that silently disappeared.** `HistoryPanel`
 * was never deleted — it rendered, `.history-row` existed, every row carried
 * `data-history-conversation` — but the control-rail redesign (`debaae0`)
 * dropped `onOpenHistory` when it replaced the drawer with this component, and
 * `setShowingHistory(true)` was then called from nowhere. The log keeps every
 * conversation forever and the UI had no way to reach any of them. Nothing
 * failed: not typecheck, not lint, not the suite.
 *
 * A rendered test rather than a pure one because the defect *is* the rendered
 * button — there is no pure part to extract. The e2e spec that would have caught
 * it reaches the sheet through the drawer this component replaced, so it cannot
 * catch anything either; that is exactly why the guard belongs in the fast suite
 * instead.

        Offered under the words, not beside the name.

        Two rules decide where this goes. The first is what it is *for*: only a
        message can be handed off — a notice saying "NOTE: tool_progress" carries
        nothing to the other agent — which is why the condition is unchanged from
        when it lived in the head.

        The second is when you decide. It sat top-right, level with the speaker,
        so the one control that moves a reply to the other agent was offered
        before the reply had been read. Handing off is a judgement about what was
        said; it belongs after the saying. Under the message it is also next to
        the composer, which is the other thing you might do instead — reply
        yourself — and those two choices now sit together rather than at opposite
        ends of the row.

              Handing off and going ahead are both *doing* something with the
              reply; a recap is a way of looking at where the work stands. With
              `space-between` on the row that split puts the two acts together at
              the left and leaves the right edge to the one that only reads.

              Hand off has since left this group for a line of its own below —
              see the comment on its own block — so the first line is now
              "ask this reply again" on the left and "where does the work
              stand" on the right, which is the same split one level narrower.

                It used to live on the quote offer, so the input was whatever the
                pointer had dragged over — and `openAside` re-checks that text
                against the reply as the log holds it. Every element of chrome
                inside `.entry` that the projection cannot produce was therefore
                a way to be told "That passage is not part of that reply", which
                is what someone selecting a long answer kept meeting. A whole
                reply is a prefix of what the log holds by construction, so this
                path has nothing to disagree about.

                to "I do not follow this" are asking the other agent and asking

              It shared the left of the first line with Explain simply, and the
              two ran together as one phrase: "Hand off → Explain simply" reads
              as an instruction to hand off in order to explain, which is not
              what either does. The arrow is what makes it happen — a label

              this row that leaves this conversation's own thread, so a line to
              itself is the honest shape rather than only a way of breaking the
              phrase.

              Same mechanism as `Go ahead` below: `flex-basis: 100%` in the
              wrapping row, so `.entry` keeps its three-row grid template and
              this stays a change to one rule.

              It has since become the line rather than one label on it: the three
              quick intents stack down its left and the arrow sits at its right,

                  a lot of chrome for something almost always wanted on the
                  newest one — the same rule `Recap` follows two blocks up, and

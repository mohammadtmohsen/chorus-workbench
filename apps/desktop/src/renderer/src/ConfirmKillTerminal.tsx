/**
 * The one question asked before a shell is killed, and only when there is
 * something to lose.
 *
 * `describe()` reports `busy` as "something other than the shell itself is in
 * the foreground", so an idle `zsh` dies on the click and never reaches this.
 * Asking every time is the friction people learn to click through, which makes
 * the confirmation worthless on the one occasion it matters — a `pnpm build`
 * halfway done, an `ssh` session, a `psql` transaction.
 *
 * The process name is the whole content. "Are you sure?" is not information;
 * "`pnpm` is still running in it" is the sentence that decides the answer, and
 * it is the reason `terminal:describe` has existed unused since the original
 * plan's Phase 1.
 *
 * Shaped after the session-end dialog that used to sit beside it, deliberately: two destructive
 * confirmations that looked different would be two things to learn.

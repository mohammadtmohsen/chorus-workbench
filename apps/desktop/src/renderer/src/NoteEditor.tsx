 * underline, strike, link, both lists, blockquote, code and code block — so the
 * install is five packages rather than the twenty-five FlowDrive's document
 * editor needs for tables, colour, alignment and task lists. It was measured
 * before it was accepted, which is the rule the Monaco entry in `CLAUDE.md` set.
 *
 * **It does not breach the no-`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` rule**, and that is a
 * property of ProseMirror rather than a promise: a document is a typed tree and
 * the view builds nodes from it. Nothing is interpolated into markup.

 *   It has to sit in a lookbehind: inside `match[0]` it would fail TipTap's own
 *   re-check, which compares the match against the document's real text and
 *   finds nothing where the break was.
 * - **The indent is inside the match**, because spaces are real text and survive
 *   that check. Consuming them is what stops an indented line leaving its indent
 *   behind as a paragraph of blanks.

       * no previous value — the text in the box *is* the note.
       *
       * **The editor's handler and not a second one on the element.** There was

       * `removeAllRanges()` by a frame. The second one landed after the caret had

       * failure `leave` is written to avoid, arriving from the other direction.

        Jira's grip: hover a paragraph and drag it somewhere else in the note.

        A portal the extension positions against whichever block the pointer is
        over, so there is nothing here to place — what the note has to provide is
        somewhere for it to sit, which is why both notes pad their left edge by
        `--note-grip` on top of their own padding. Without that the handle would
        land on the first few characters of every line.

        Top-level blocks, and blocks directly inside a box. Nothing else: a list
        item and a line inside a quote still have no grip, because dragging one
        bullet out of its list is a different gesture from moving a paragraph and
        is worth adding deliberately rather than by leaving a default on. That
        refusal is older than the box and survives it.

        **`allowedContainers` is the option that looks like it says this, and it
        does not.** It drops every candidate below the document unless an ancestor
        is named — and a top-level paragraph is below the document, so naming
        `noteBox` there takes the grip off every block that is *not* in a box.
        Once `nested` is on there is no path back to the top-level behaviour
        either; the handle simply hides. Read out of the extension's own dist,
        after this had already been planned the wrong way round.

        So the rule is written out instead, with the built-in set off: those make
        list *items* the target inside a list, which is the thing being refused.
        A deduction of 1000 is exclusion — the base score is 1000 and a score of
        zero or less is dropped.

        **Edge detection is off, and no setting of it could have worked.** Both
        were tried against the running app. With `left`, moving off the text
        towards the grip put the inner block permanently near an edge while the
        box, a gutter further out, took no penalty — so the handle jumped to the
        box out from under the pointer chasing it. With `top` instead, the upper
        12px of every 21px line counted as near that block's top while the box was
        nowhere near its own, so the target flipped between the block and the box
        within a single line. One flaw, twice: `isNearEdge` is a half-plane and
        not a band, and a strip is the only thing that would have helped.

        Off, nothing is penalised, every candidate keeps the base 1000, and the
        tie is broken by depth — the deepest block under the pointer, every time
        and everywhere. That is the stability, and it is also why the box needs a
        region of its own.

        **The box's own top padding is that region, and it is measured rather than
        scored.** `inBoxGrabStrip` asks whether the pointer is below a box's top
        and above its first child's top — bounded, and overlapping no text, since
        a first child's own top margin is zeroed in the stylesheet.

        **Outside its strip a box is not a candidate at all**, which is what keeps
        a grip reachable. The gutter a handle sits in is the box's padding rather
        than any block's, so a point there can resolve to the box itself — and a
        box that could win from the gutter would move the handle out from under a
        pointer on its way to it, below it, or anywhere in the margin beside it.
        With no candidate the extension returns without hiding anything, so the
        handle holds its place; that is the same answer as padding `.note-drag`'s
        hit area out to meet the text, one axis over.

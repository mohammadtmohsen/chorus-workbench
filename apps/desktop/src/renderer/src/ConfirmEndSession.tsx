/**
 * The question asked before a conversation is ended with something still in it.
 *
 * **Asked only when there is something to lose**, which is the same rule
 * `ConfirmRestart` states and the reason either is worth asking at all. Ending a
 * quiet conversation loses nothing: the log is append-only and the transcript
 * stays in History. Three things are not quiet, and each is unrecoverable in its
 * own way — a turn in flight is discarded, a decision nobody answered is a room
 * that was waiting on a person, and a draft is text that exists nowhere else.
 *
 * **Naming what would be lost is the content.** "Are you sure?" is not
 * information. "Claude is mid-turn" is the sentence that decides the answer —
 * the argument `ConfirmKillTerminal` makes about a foreground process, and the
 * reason all three of these dialogs are shaped alike. Three destructive
 * confirmations that looked different would be three things to learn.
 *
 * One line per reason rather than a composed sentence: a translator gets whole
 * sentences to work with, and two reasons at once read as two facts rather than
 * as a clause somebody has to unpick.

 * electron-vite already knows the entry points (src/main, src/preload,

 * breaks its Electron-specific interop, so the config stays minimal on purpose.
 *
 * Two things that look incidental but are not:
 *  - This package is deliberately NOT `"type": "module"`. Electron's main
 *    process cannot take named imports from the CJS `electron` module under
 *    ESM, and a sandboxed preload must be CJS. The renderer is still ESM.
 *  - The `dev` and `preview` scripts run under `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE`.
 *    VS Code's extension host exports that variable, and it makes the Electron
 *    binary behave as plain Node — `require('electron')` returns a path string
 *    and the app dies on `app.whenReady()`.
